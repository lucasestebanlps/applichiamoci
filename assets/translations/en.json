        "APPlichiAMOci is the result of the experience gained by the Emmanuel Foundation in the field, in close contact with the needs and issues of people facing hardship and social exclusion. The belief that new technologies can be an important resource, offering innovative tools for combating and containing the phenomena of hardship and social exclusion, and the awareness that these phenomena should be addressed from a collective perspective, are the basis for the idea of merging the words APPLICATION and LOVE, which give rise to the title APPlichiAMOci. The goal is to counter conditions of disadvantage, hardship, exclusion, and social isolation through the involvement of actors and civil society, active in the field, and the implementation of volunteer services, using easily accessible interactive systems that connect service providers with recipients. The aim is to promote the development of active citizenship.",
